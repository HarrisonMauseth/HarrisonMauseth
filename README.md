Hi there! My name is Harrison (he/him). I am a new software developer currently going through
a coding bootcamp at Tech Elevator. I grew up along side the internet's major rise to
popularity in the 90's and have always enjoyed tinkering with coding. 

I got my first real taste of coding in 2012 when I started experimenting with lighting design.
Most major brands of consoles have a CLI and learning to utilize that tool was absolutely
crucial. While that career path didn't pan out, it opened the doors to world of
microcontrollers and 3D printing.

Stay tuned to find out what I'm working on next!
