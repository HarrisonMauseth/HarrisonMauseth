# Welcome!
Hi there! My name is Harrison (he/him). I am a software developer who recently completed an internship as a .NET Developer as well as a 
recent graduate from Tech Elevator's Java Full Stack software development bootcamp.

## About Me

As a lifelong learner, I've found that the most rewarding way to learn is by throwing myself fully into whatever I find interesting.
That's exactly what this GitHub page is all about. I am taking what I have learned and finding creative solutions to problems that
don't exist (but provide a quality of life upgrade in my life). More often then not, this approach starts with me thinking
"how hard could could this be?" right before I throw myself head first into a concept I know nothing about. I might not always come
out the other side with a finished project, but I always find a way to add the experience into my toolbelt for the future.

Stay tuned to find out what I'm working on next!

## Recent Projects:
In order of the complexity, here is a one sentence overview of the three personal projects I have been working on most recently.
- **Pet Food Tracker** - *a full stack application that can answer the question "did you feed the dogs?" without ever having to ask*
- **Network Connectivity Monitor** - *the easiest way to show your ISP that their new system isn't working is by bringing a database full of proof*
- **Random Meal Generator** - *if you took a Venn diagram that has "ways to make life feel like a TTRPG", "ways to study OOP fundamentals", and "ways to get rid of food that's about to expire", the intersection would be this project*
